            <p class="text">
              This is the first project that I did in this "Webbutvecklings"
              course. It was also the first time I tried coding in HTML and CSS.
              The assignment was to create a simple webpage with both text and
              images. I also had to add different links, I used absulute,
              relative and complete links as well as links inside the website.
              the outcome was a webpage that looked like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="projectpicture-one projectpicture"
              src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift1bild.png"
              alt="Picture of prject 1."
            />
          </div>
          <div class="center flex">
            <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 2.</h3>
            <p class="text text2">
              This was the second project. This time I was familiar with basics
              so this went a little smother. The assignment was to use "div" and
              flexbox to being able to move text and pictures. And the outcome
              looked like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="projectpicture-two projectpicture"
              src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift2bild.png"
              alt="Picture of project 2."
            />
          </div>
          <div class="center flex">
            <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 3.</h3>
            <p class="text text3">
              This was the third project. This assignment was to get
              familiarized position. This went well and I also learned to use
              the css-properties sticky and fixed. The outcome looked like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
              src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift3bild.png"
              alt="Picture of project 3"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="center flex">
            <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 4.</h3>
            <p class="text text4">
              This was the fourth project. This time i learned to inbed
              animations into the css code. I also learned to add a youtube
              video on the webpage that plays if you click on it and if you
              want, you can view it in fullscreen. The outcome looked like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
              src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift4bild.png"
              alt="Picture of project 4"
            />

          <div class="center flex">
            <h3 class="projecttext">Assignment 5.</h3>
            <p class="text text5">
              This was the fifth project. Display: grid was what I was learning
              about this time. I learned to change grid rows and grid columns
              aswell as the gaps inbetween. This how it ended up looking:
            </p>
            <img
              class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
              src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift5bild.png"
              alt="Picture of project 5"
