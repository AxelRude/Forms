                  This is the first project that I did in this "Webbutvecklings"
                  course. It was also the first time I tried coding in HTML and
                  CSS. The assignment was to create a simple webpage with both
                  text and images. I also had to add different links, I used
                  absulute, relative and complete links as well as links inside
                  the website. the outcome was a webpage that looked like this:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="projectpicture-one projectpicture"
                  src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift1bild.png"
                  alt="Picture of prject 1."
                />
              </div>

              <div class="projects">
                <p class="text">
                  This was the second project. This time I was familiar with
                  basics so this went a little smother. The assignment was to
                  use "div" and flexbox to being able to move text and pictures.
                  And the outcome looked like this:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="projectpicture-two projectpicture"
                  src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift2bild.png"
                  alt="Picture of project 2."
                />

              <div class="projects">
                <p class="text">
                  This was the third project. This assignment was to get
                  familiarized position. This went well and I also learned to
                  use the css-properties sticky and fixed. The outcome looked
                  like this:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
                  src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift3bild.png"
                  alt="Picture of project 3"

              <div class="projects">
                <p class="text">
                  This was the fourth project. This time i learned to inbed
                  animations into the css code. I also learned to add a youtube
                  video on the webpage that plays if you click on it and if you
                  want, you can view it in fullscreen. The outcome looked like
                  this:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
                  src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift4bild.png"
                  alt="Picture of project 4"

                <p class="text">
                  This was the fifth project. Display: grid was what I was
                  learning about this time. I learned to change grid rows and
                  grid columns aswell as the gaps inbetween. This how it ended
                  up looking:
                </p>
                <img
                  class="projectpicture-three projectpicture"
                  src="/Images/Images for portfolio/Uppgift5bild.png"
                  alt="Picture of project 5"
                />
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="part">
              <header class="projecttext">History and DOM</header>
              <div class="projects">
                <p class="text">
                  This is yet another project that I have been working on. First
                  I read up on some of the history in HTML and DOM. Then I added
                  the information i found to the webpage. In the webpage I also
                  learned to use semantic elements. After I was finished with
                  the history I read up on different laws and regulations that
                  effected webdevelopment and added it to the webpage. I also
                  made it possible for people who onlt use the keyboard, example
                  by adding a skip to main content link. Then I learned how to
                  make the page responsive. I made so that when you made the
                  page wider och thinner it changed a bit. This to allow people
                  on phone or ipad to have a pleasent experience on the webpage.
                  Lastly I learned to use forms. I used this to add a part where
                  you could send an email to my mailadress directly via the
                  webpage.
